# Blazed City Demo
First Python implementation of the Blazed City standard.

* Please refer to the standard (in [docs/STANDARD.md](/docs/STANDARD.md)) to learn more about the Blazed City standards.
* Also, you may refer to the constitution (in [docs/CONSTITUTION.md](/docs/CONSTITUTION.md)) to learn more about the City being implemented in this demo.

## What is a Blazed City?
A Blazed City is a virtual containment group for a system of data. This is essentially a container ecosystem, which gives the developer framework and architecture to ditstribute systems and data over a centralized, decentralized, or hybrid authority/authorities.

> Great, but how does it work?

## Overview
A City is a centralized container which better empowers the development team to vest authority over a given span of data (and dynamic systems), into a network/system of addressed plots, all of which can be inter-networked together as needed. Cities can then connect to other cities (in multicast or point-to-point relationships) called "Worlds". Worlds can also connect point-to-point with other Worlds accross the internet, this is known as universe traversal.

## Mechanics
In [src/main.py](/src/main.py), you'll find the main program entry point. Here, we provision our demo city, Blazed. It is then loaded up with its three towns, which have all been provisioned in their respective folders under the impl directory. Inside the [src/blz](/src/blz/) directory, you will find the Python implementation of the Blazed City standards. This will soon be turned into a library that can be installed from github or pip.
