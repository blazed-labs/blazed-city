# Blazed City Demo
First Python implementation of the Blazed City standard.

## What is a Blazed City?
A Blazed City is a virtual containment group for a system of data. This is essentially a container ecosystem, which gives the developer framework and architecture to ditstribute systems and data over a centralized, decentralized, or hybrid authority/authorities.

## How does it work?
A City is a centralized container which better empowers the development team to vest authority over a given span of data (and dynamic systems), into a network/system of addressed plots, all of which can be inter-networked together as needed. Cities can then connect to other cities (in multicast or point-to-point relationships) called "Worlds". Worlds can also connect point-to-point with other Worlds accross the internet, this is known as universe traversal.
