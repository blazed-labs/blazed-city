## Overview
The Blazed City standard outlines the method by which a city may be provisioned and constructed, how authority may be delegated, and finally how order may be established.

## It all begins with "We the People"
Before a city may even come to be, many principal controllers (ie. keys to power) must come together in union to realize this grand goal. The constitution is vital to the establishment of a city or governing principality, the constitution essentially invokes the authority of the aforementioned "keys to power" and assigns (ie. vets) the authority in/amonst the entity/entities defined by the constitution as the "government" or "governing body".
Beyond this, the document also outlines the various rules and procedures to be encforced and promoted by/within the City.

## It all ends with a signature
On a physical document, a hand-written signature may be provided. In the age of the internet, we may also use randomly generated cryptographic keys to sign documents. The signature ensures the authenticity of the document, that it cannot be changed or forged without altering the corresponding signature, of which cannot be feasibly counterfeited without the special "key", which can be easily regenerated if compromised.

## Method or Function
A Method or Function is a collection of instructions, or procedures, which (given an optional set of inputs), produces either a direct valued result (via "return"), or performs indirect operations upon exterior regions of the city (in which case, the method returns "void"). 

## Variable
A variable is any defined object or label that can hold a value. The value has a type, optional headers, and a "payload", consisting of data. Variables combine together to form "Items".

## Items
An item is a combination of data, such that each data element is wrapped in a variable and instantiated by a constructor method, which performs any "item-specific" construction functionality. An Item may also have methods attached to it.

## Land
Within the constitution, or supporting articles, the city is expected to make a "Land Claim", of which the "City" invokes its principal controllers (ie. keys to power), then invokes the article(s) of property being constituted into the "City", and declares the ordainment of ownership for divisions of the defined "Land", to be defined by a "Deed", issued by the "City", and containing a value signed by both the City and the standing owner's private key. The Land within a City can be virtual or physical.

## Spaces
Spaces are descrete portions of land, which initially are empty and/or subject to Natural conditions. These portions always have a unique access address, whether they are physical or virtual. This access address allows a space to be referenced in exterior - via explicit (or interior - via implicit) context. Each space is tied to a deed, and can be owned by itself, or in a collection with other adjacent spaces.

## Systems
A System is like a Item, its a group of methods which act in an isolated state manner. But unlike an item, a system contains many items. For example, we might use a "System" to implement the functionality of a "Vehicle". Thus, we can combine all methods (or method calls/references), variables, and/or items.
